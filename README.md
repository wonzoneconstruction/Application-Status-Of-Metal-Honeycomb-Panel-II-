 Honeycomb metal panel also has the following applications:

(6) Energy. (a) Energy storage: metal honeycomb has excellent light absorption performance. Solar panels with honeycomb structure can be manufactured by using the light absorption property of honeycomb. In the heat collecting panel, the heat insulating layer adopts honeycomb sandwich structure. Honeycomb core can use paper honeycomb with better insulation performance. Thin metal panels can be used for inner and outer plates. The panel is bonded to the core with adhesive. Light absorbing honeycomb adopts metal honeycomb core with better thermal conductivity. Glass plate and light - absorbing honeycomb with transparent adhesive bonding. Heat conducting panel and light absorbing honeycomb are bonded with heat conducting adhesive. The honeycomb heat collector has the advantages of high efficiency, strong integrity and light weight. Metal honeycomb can also be used in the development of solar water heater tanks, solar collectors, solar cells, etc. It can also be used for mining and application of terrestrial heat source. (b) Heat insulation: Metal honeycomb can be used as heat insulation material for its high porosity, high temperature resistance, temperature change resistance and oxidation resistance. Honeycomb itself does not provide heat insulation, but honeycomb sandwich panels (metal plate-honeycomb - metal plate) provide it. Thermal insulation materials can be widely used in aerospace. (c) Heat dissipation: When the through-hole metal honeycomb is in a high-thermal fluid, it has high heat dissipation capacity because of its large specific surface area and complex three-dimensional flow. Under natural convection conditions, increasing pore diameter and porosity within a certain range can increase the heat transfer capacity of convection, and forced convection can improve the heat transfer capacity. Multilayer honeycomb structure has been widely used as acoustic device and compact heat exchanger, and can be widely used in automobile engine radiator and heat exchanger, etc.

 (7) Chemical industry. In chemical industry, taking advantage of the high specific surface area, high porosity, fluid permeability and selectivity of metal honeycomb , metal honeycomb can play an active role in liquid-liquid separation, solid-liquid separation and gas-solid separation in chemical fertilizer, pharmaceutical, water treatment, organic chemical, food and other industries. It will have the potential broad application space. For example, the fluid heat and mass transfer performance will be greatly improved when it is used in a packed bed. In general, the flow rate is not too high in a honeycomb particle stationary packed bed. The mass transfer mode is pair mass transfer and molecular diffusion. Between the wall surface of the packed bed container and the honeycomb particle layer inside the bed, the heat transfer modes are heat conduction, convection and heat radiation (high temperature). As a new functional material structure with strong vitality, metal honeycomb will be widely used in chemical separation field, efficient catalyst carrier, efficient battery electrode, reaction tower filler, heat pipe liquid wick, etc.
